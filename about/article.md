title: About Me
status: draft
template: about.html

Hi, I'm Brian Schrader. I'm an independent software developer, writer, and musician living in San Diego, CA. This site is my little home on the internet where I go on (and on) about things that are important to me.

I own and run [SkyRocket Software][sky], my indie software company, where I make things some people like. I'm a co-founder of [Adventurer's Codex][ac], a tool for enhancing and tracking D&D games. And I'm the singer, song-writer, and guitarist of [The Fourth Section][tfs].

Oh, and I wrote a book about [how to be an Indie Developer](https://goingindie.tech)!

I frequent lots of places on the Internet most of which I've included in the sidebar on the [home page](/) of this site. I [read a lot][read], I [write music][bc], and I [build things][gh]. I've open sourced a [few][cache] [different][b2] [things][variant], and I’ve built an [HTCPCP-compliant Coffee Pot][coffee].

In the past, I worked for a research institute and I continue to hang around academia [in the work I do for my company][sky]. I've worked on a few different things that have [since been published][scholar] and recently I've begun my own independent research projects.

Very occasionally, I write for [a few local papers][bib] about topics like urbanism, climate change, and other realms of public policy.

I built this site in 2012 to teach myself programming and I've been blogging here ever since. Since then [I've worked][li] in government, medical research, and at a start-up. Technically I learned how to build planes and rockets in school, but I doubt I'd remember any of that now. 🚀
