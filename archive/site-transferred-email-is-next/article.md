Ok, so I've moved my website off of shared hosting to Linode and everything is great. I haven't added the new features to my blog engine yet, but I'll get to that. First though is the problem of what do I do with my email. Currently, its hosted with my domain provider and part of my shared hosting plan (which I no longer need). I'm looking to move my email off of my domain provider to something more private. I'm thinking about Rackspace or Zoho right now.

If you have any suggestions please let me know. I'm looking to host 2-4 email addresses as cost effectively as possible (calendar and contact syncing is not needed. iCloud does that just fine).
