> It's long seemed ridiculous to me that it's not easier to transfer funds between people electronically. After all, your bank account and my bank account are little more than entries in a ledger somewhere, represented by 1s and 0s. Why should it be any harder for me to send you some bits that turn into money than it is for me to send you an email?

> In theory, Apple could even offer the ability to send funds to people via the Internet. Apple Pay already works for some online transactions, and once again Square Cash has proved that you can transfer funds online without too much hassle.

Please, please Apple, Square, Chase, <del>Google</del>, please make this real. The day sharing a check with friends or paying someone back for lunch becomes as easy as it is with cash is the day I abandon cash forever. And I'd never look back.
