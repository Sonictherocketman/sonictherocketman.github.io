Nearly two years ago, my band [The Fourth Section](https://thefourthsection.com) released an EP called [Glass &amp; Stone](/archive/the-road-to-glass--stone/) and this month we released our first, full-length album: Paper Peaks.

Recording an album has been a long-time goal of mine and something we as a band have been working toward for over three years.

I don't have much to say about the album, other than you should listen to it, but I can say it's been a true honor to have been able to make something like this with such amazing people. The three of us have worked hard since March to record, produce, publish, and promote the thing and it's taken a lot more out of us than I think we expected. Paper Peaks was a labor of love and something that could not have been done save for the support of my bandmates, our producer Jeff Berkley, and so many others.

If you like indie-rock and alt-rock, give it a listen and if you like it, please share it with your friends.
