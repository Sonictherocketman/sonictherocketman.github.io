Once again [Primitive Tech][pt] amazes me. If you haven't heard of this YouTube
channel, you should check it out (you should read his blog posts too). So far, 
he's mostly built huts ([one even had a fireplace][hut]) and primitive tools, but with the latest video, he's taken on building a furnace hot enough to smelt metal. It's super simple in concept, and looks pretty effective.

It's amazing what he's able to build with clay and water.
