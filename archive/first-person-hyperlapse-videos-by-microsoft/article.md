"We present a method for converting first-person videos, for example, captured with a helmet camera during activities such as rock climbing or bicycling, into hyper-lapse videos, i.e., time-lapse videos with a smoothly moving camera."</div>

Fresh out of Microsoft Labs is this new what they call ["Hyperlapse" videos][1]. You have to check it out. If you have a Go-Pro or other first-person camera, you'll need this (They're working on a Windows app).

My favorite part is the fact that they included their technical papers with the release. They're obviously looking for people to  mess with and improve their algorithm (the way software should be).
