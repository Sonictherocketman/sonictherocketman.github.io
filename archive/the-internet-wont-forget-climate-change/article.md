A lot of you might have seen this post on Thursday.

![The tweet about NOAA](//aftp-cmdl-noaa-gov.brianschrader.com/theme/tweet.png)

I did, though I didn't put it in with my baby pictures, [I put it here][1].

At [aftp-cmdl-noaa-gov.brianschrader.com][1] is a full mirror of the contents of that FTP site. It has all of the CO2 and Aerosol data that NOAA has made available (all the way back to 1976). If you find this data useful, I'd love to hear from you.

If you're looking for other climate change related data sets, [The Climate Mirror Project][2] has lots of mirrors of NASA, NOAA, and other organizations. We will not allow this data to be forgotten. Climate change is real, it's a problem, and it's getting worse. [Ignoring it cannot be the solution][3].

The Internet should not forget; we can't let it forget something this important.
