The final project for my rocket propulsion class was to build a simulation of a water-air composite structure rocket (basically a bottle rocket on steroids). The goal of the assignment was to design a rocket to beat the [world record][record] (at time of writing it was 663 meters). 

In the pre-finals rush, I whipped up this simulation and I've uploaded the code to GitHub. It was recommended to do the simulation in MatLab, but I wanted to practice my Python. Anyway, here's the [link to the repository][git].
