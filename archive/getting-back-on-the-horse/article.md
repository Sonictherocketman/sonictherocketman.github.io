It's been a while since my last post. This whole summer has been an unusually quiet here, and while a number of personal issues have cropped up this summer that derailed me from blogging, I've really just gotten out of the habit of writing regularly. This is me forcing myself back onto that horse. I've got some exciting news coming, and between work and Adventurer's Codex, I've been keeping myself way too busy.

On the [Adventurer's Codex][ac] front: we're in the middle of a large refactor caused by our ongoing migration to Webpack which should hopefully fix a bug caused by our fairly primitive current build and deploy system. We're starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel now, and hopefully it shouldn't take much longer before we're back to writing new, cool features. The original build and deploy system was basically a lot of manual work and a shell script. When we wrote it, I had no idea what Webpack was or how to deploy a modern front-end app, now I do. That's what happens when you learn on the go; sometimes you have to step back and fix your past mistakes.

In my dwindling spare time, I've been working on another project that I hope to announce soon, so look for more to come there.
