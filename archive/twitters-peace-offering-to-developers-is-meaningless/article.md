> Especially at Twitter. Twitter started out as a developer-friendly company, then they became a developer-hostile company, and now they're trying to be a developer-friendly company again. If I had to pick a company to have absolute power over something very important, Twitter wouldn't be very high on the list...

> Twitter will never, and should never, have any credibility with developers again. Enjoy it while it lasts, but be ready for it to disappear at any moment.

Agreed. Twitter is still a great product, but its not happy with what it is. Twitter is always seeking to ruin itself by trying to be Facebook. I can't wait until [something else comes along][1].
