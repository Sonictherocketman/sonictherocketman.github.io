John's [most recent Primitive Technology blog post][pt] has me pretty excited. The new video is great, as his videos tend to be, but the post mentions something a bit more exciting.

> I bought a new property to shoot primitive technology videos on. The new area is dense tropical rainforest with a permanent creek. Starting completely from scratch, my first project was to build a simple dome hut and make a fire.

This is just me speculating here, but he wouldn't be buying a whole new plot of land to shoot videos on if he wasn't planning on making more videos long term. While I never had any reason to believe he'd be stopping anytime soon, such a big purchase is great news for him, his channel, and fans like me.
