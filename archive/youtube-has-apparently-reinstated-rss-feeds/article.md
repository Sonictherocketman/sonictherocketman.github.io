Well if there's something I wasn't expecting to find tonight, it was that apparently YouTube has decided to allow users to [follow channels via RSS again][yt-help], and unlike the last few years, this time it actually looks to be officially supported!

> Get RSS updates for a single channel
To get an RSS feed of a single channelâ€™s uploads, paste the channel URL into your RSS reader.

> Get RSS updates for all subscriptions
To import all your YouTube subscriptions to your RSS reader, you can use our OPML file download feature...

I have no idea when this feature was added, but it's the first time I've seen it.<sup>1</sup> Most articles about YouTube's RSS feeds are either hacks or from [ancient history][reader]. I don't know what mad(wo)man is behind this, but I love them.

<sup>1</sup> Hopefully this isn't just some short-lived A/B testing or worse.
