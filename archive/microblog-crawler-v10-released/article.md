Today, I'm proud to announce that version 1.0 of my Microblog/RSS feed crawler is released. It's [up on GitHub][1] for all to see and installation is as easy as:

`pip install microblogcrawler`

From the README:

> [The MicroblogCrawler is a] basic feed crawler/parser for traversing microblog and RSS feeds.

Some quick notes about the project:

- It's written in Python.
- It's my first project to be officially released on PyPi
- This crawler is actually an offshoot project from my [Microblogger][2] project. 
- The crawler's API is modeled after the [Tweepy][3] StreamListener API.
- The crawler is 241 lines long, and a significant portion of those line are documentation (~35%).
