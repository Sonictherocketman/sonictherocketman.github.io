Last night I went stargazing with a few friends, and while the weather did conspire against us we did get a few good chances to see the stars through a friend's telescope. The photos through the telescope are no where near as good as the actual sights, but that's largely because we didn't bring any camera equipment. With time, practice, and proper gear, we'd likely have done a lot better. That said, w e also took some pictures just with our phones and the results were a lot more impressive than any of us expected.

    This is the best shot I could get through the telescope eyepiece with my phone. The actual view was great, but the pictures: not so much.

            Turns out that the cameras on our phones are very, very good.
