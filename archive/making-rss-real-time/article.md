> One of the critiques of RSS feeds in a world dominated by Facebook and Twitter is that RSS just isn't fast enough. You can't hope to achieve what Twitter calls "in-the-moment updates" and "watch events unfold" if your client is polling each web site's RSS feed once an hour for new microblog posts.

> Luckily this was solved years ago. Many blogging apps (including WordPress) have a setting to "ping" another server when a post has been published. When it receives this notification, the other server can request the RSS feed and make note of the new post right away.

[Manon](http://www.manton.org) is right. This is actually a huge issue with the [Open Microblog spec][1] right now. I'm still trying to come up with a standard way of working around this issue (if you have suggestions, [contact me][2]).
