It's official: the [Pine.blog app for iOS][app] is available on the App Store! The app is free for all and requires a premium subscription to [Pine.blog](https://pine.blog).

With this version you can quickly and easily check up on your timeline and your favorites, and the app refreshes in the background so that you're always up to date with the latest news and posts from any site you follow.

Version 1.0 is pretty slimmed down, which is why I was able to get something out so quickly after the initial Pine launch, but don't worry; there's lots of great features planned for the app. Overall, I'm trying to keep releases fairly small so that they can be released more often.

So far, I'm planning for v1.1 to include the ability to:

- Post to your own site, just like you can on the website.
- See who you follow and to follow and unfollow sites from the app.
- Preview images from posts directly from the timeline (like how a lot of Twitter apps show images).

Thanks to all the Pine users for making this possible, and if you enjoy Pine, please tell your friends!
