Dave Winer:

> Without Wikipedia the web would be fully dominated by business models. There would be no way to get the simple single fact you need. If there weren't such a thing as Wikipedia, with all its flaws, we'd wish there was. Or in the future you would tell the younguns about this thing that was so wonderful that had just the facts you wanted and nothing more, and they'd roll their eyes.

Try to picture the internet without Wikipedia. When that terrible idea starts to give you chills, please consider donating to Wikipedia; I did.
