[Ursula Le Guin][1] hit it out of the park, with her speech, at the National Book awards. Her speech in defense of Science-Fiction/Fantasy writers as the "realists of a larger reality," and her impassioned call for writers to stop allowing themselves to be "sold like deodorant" really takes the cake.
