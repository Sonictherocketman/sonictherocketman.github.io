title: Overcast 2.5 Update
author: Brian Schrader
tags: overcast, podcasts
status: publish

A much appreciated update to my favorite podcast player. Marco has spent a lot of time on the various battery improvements and fine tuning the features that make Overcast special. My favorite new feature: dark mode.

> A dark theme has been Overcast’s most requested feature since 2.0 knocked streaming off the list. I also wanted to offer patrons something special for supporting Overcast...

> It features Apple’s new San Francisco font and a modern blue accent color for a fresh new look that’s still distinctly Overcast.

Another feature I'm looking forward to trying out is the new private uploads feature.

> I also often get requests for Overcast to play files outside of podcast feeds, such as lecture recordings, audiobooks, and privately distributed podcasts.

I can't wait to have my audiobooks in Overcast as well.
