Michael Morris (11/9/2018 - Textual Newsletter):

> It is with a heavy heart that I must announce that I will be stepping down as the only full time maintainer of Textual. Textual isn't as profitable as it used to be... [and] I do not see it recovering to the point I can continue doing it full time...

> I also must step down because I am burnt out from doing the same thing for the past 8+ years... Textual will not disappear from the Earth completely. I still have plans to do infrequent small improvements though I can't make any promises when and what those will contain.

I'm really bummed to hear that Michael is stepping away from Textual and even more-so because it's partially for financial reasons. I've been a Textual customer for years now and I love the app; I plan to continue using it as long as it runs on my Mac.

Developing indie-software is difficult and 8+ years is a really good run. I wish him the best with his next project.
