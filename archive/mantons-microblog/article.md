Like [lots][1] of [other][2] [people][3] have said, [Manton Reece][4] has [started a Kickstarter][5] for his [Micro.blog][6] microblogging platform. I've been on the beta for a while, and I've mentioned it before. What Manton is doing is really important, and not only should you support his work, but spread the word.

> Do you remember how the web used to work? How the web was supposed to work?

> In the earlier days of the web, we always published to our own web site. If you weren’t happy with your web host, or they went out of business, you could move your files and your domain name, and nothing would break.

> Today, most writing instead goes into a small number of centralized social networking sites, where you can’t move your content, advertisements and fake news are everywhere, and if one of these sites fails, your content disappears from the internet. Too many sites have gone away and taken our posts and photos with them.

> I want to encourage more independent writing. To do that, we need better tools that embrace microblogs and the advantages of the open web. We need to learn from the success and user experience of social networking, but applied to the full scope of the web.

[Indie Microblogging: owning your short-form writing &#8594;][5]

I've written lots of stuff about services like Manton's, and the Open Web in general. It's really important that we preserve not just the way the Web used to work, but as Manton says: the way it **should work**.
