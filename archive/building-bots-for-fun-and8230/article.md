For all of the good things about Mastodon and the Fediverse more broadly, the technology has so far struggled to spread far outside of tech circles and into the broader public. Mastodon especially is pretty big these days, but its mostly filled with a lot of computer nerds like myself; there really isn't a very large music scene like there is on other social media sites.

<div class="image-container" style="padding-left: 1rem;">
<iframe allowfullscreen sandbox="allow-top-navigation allow-scripts allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox" width="320" height="400" src="https://www.mastofeed.com/apiv2/feed?userurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.social%2Fusers%2Fsdmusiceventsbot&theme=auto&size=80&header=true&replies=false&boosts=false"></iframe>
</div>

I wanted to help fix that, so I threw together a simple [Mastodon bot][1] (a toot bot?) that regularly shares information about local music shows in San Diego.

With the [San Diego Reader][2] as its data source, the bot posts every hour about shows happening in the next day or two. Hopefully it will help my fellow San Diegans keep tabs on the music scene, and help to inspire more musicians and local music fans onto the platform.

So if you're at all interested in the San Diego music scene, be sure to follow [sdmusiceventsbot][1] on Mastodon! And if you're a local artist, make sure you [add your event][1] to the Reader to get yourself noticed by the bot! Be warned, San Diego has a lot of shows (more than the bot could ever reasonably post without looking like spam), so not all shows will get posted. The choices are random, so it's all up to the luck of the dice.
