Today I'm excited to announce my new podcast. [Indie Dev Life][1] is a show about the ins and outs of indie software development, and episode 1 is out today in all the right places.

I've wanted to make a podcast for years, but I've never found a topic or theme that I felt I could adequately discuss. Luckily, that changed when I finished writing my upcoming book: [Going Indie][2]. There was so much that didn't make it into the final draft, and a podcast is the perfect place to expand and explore the more complex, technical and nuanced topics I didn't get to in the book.

The first episode is an attempt to dispel any myths about Indie Development and help convince you to go independent yourself.

I'd love any feedback on the show, the audio quality, or the format and I'd appreciate any topic suggestions. I hope you'll all give [Indie Dev Life][1] a listen. If you like the show, please subscribe and give it a review on [Apple Podcasts][3].
