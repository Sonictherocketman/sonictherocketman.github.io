*From the author:*

Hello everyone!

That's right, I'm writing a book and it's about how to become an independent developer! The book combines everything I've learned over the past 6 years about being a developer and business owner. If you're nervous or unsure about how to start a company, how to design a commercial product, how to run servers, or how to market your product, then this is the book for you.

Being an indie developer is hard work, but it's incredibly rewarding as well. This book guides you through the process of setting up your own software company and building a stable, quality product. The software industry is awash in stories and advice for people looking to make it big in Silicon Valley. Those books teach you how to apply for Venture Capital, how to do Growth Hacking (whatever that is), and how to sell out. This book isn't that. Instead I focus on the skills and experience needed to launch a product on today's Web, what technologies are useful and what are just distractions, and how to build your dreams on a budget or even part-time.

Going Indie is still being written, but I'd appreciate it if you'd share the book with your friends and family. There will be a book cover reveal soon! Check back for more information, and [subscribe to the newsletter][1] to get updates in your inbox as soon as they're announced.

Thanks,<br />
Brian
