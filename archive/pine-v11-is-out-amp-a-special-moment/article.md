title: Pine v1.1 is Out &amp; A Special Moment
author: Brian Schrader
tags: indie, app development, fracture
status: publish

Pine [v1.1 for iOS][itunes] is out today! This release ended up being a bit smaller than I'd originally intended, but it has enough fixes and improvements that I didn't want to sit on it any longer. Along with a few bug fixes and performance enhancements, Version 1.1 adds a couple of really cool features:

- Images now show up in a beautiful slideshow in the timeline, rather than just in the full post view.
- Siri can now read the contents of an article to you, which is really nice for keeping up with the news on a walk or ride.
- If a feed doesn't specify an image, Pine will grab the site's App Icon, or Favicon to show instead.
- Fixes a nasty issue that would cause scrolling to be really choppy.

## Pine Joins the Wall of Apps

On an episode of [ATP](http://atp.fm) years back, Marco Arment mentioned that he gets prints of his app icons made in order to have a physical reminder of what he's built. I really liked this idea, so for the last couple of years I've done the same thing, and last week, my [Fracture][fracture] of the Pine iOS app icon arrived and is now on my wall.

    I think this is my favorite print so far. The colors are stunning.

To paraphrase Marco: Software Developers spend hundreds of hours building a thing that can affect hundreds (or thousands) of people, but since it's software, you can't touch it or take a picture of you in front of it like you can with a bridge or something.

    Pine joins Adventurer's Codex and MyGeneRank as the third app I've built (or had a big hand in building).

When you build and ship software, there's no tacky trophy, no photo of the ribbon cutting, or blueprints of the structure; nothing you can easily take home and keep as a reminder. Having physical prints (and especially Fracture prints) of your app icons is a nice little momento of all of the effort and time you spent to make a thing.
