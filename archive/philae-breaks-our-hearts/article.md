ESA
> With its batteries depleted and not enough sunlight available to recharge, Philae has fallen into 'idle mode' for a potentially long silence. In this mode, all instruments and most systems on board are shut down.

> "Prior to falling silent, the lander was able to transmit all science data gathered during the First Science Sequence", says DLR's Stephan Ulamec, Lander Manager, who was in the Main Control Room at ESOC tonight.
