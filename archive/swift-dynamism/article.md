There's been a lot of talk lately about Swift's relationship with dynamic runtime features. Since I've been developing in Swift for almost two months, I'm perfectly qualified to comment on it in depth, and that's what I'm now going to do (sorry).

First off, I like Swift's syntax a lot. Trailing closures are a thing
I didn't know I needed, and while I have a few nitpicks about the language,
overall I'm really enjoying using it.<sup>1</sup> That said, I've found myself
adopting a few strange habits when writing Swift that I'm not sure are good best
practices, but they do seem to be the way that Apple wants Swift to be written. The biggest offender, and my least favorite feature: `switch-case` statements.

Swift's `enums` are very powerful, but Apple's sample code uses them for so many things.<sup>2</sup> I've found myself `switch-case`-ing through `enums` in most of my ViewControllers. It not only looks ugly, but just feels wrong.

Brent, and many others, seem concerned about Swift's current relationship with
dynamic features. While I don't dismiss the "old guy complaining about the
new ways" effect, I never like to discount the opinions of long-time, seasoned platform developers. They've seen these kinds of things play out before. I haven't run into most of the other issues and concerns that Brent has brought up, but I have had to write more than a few `switch-case` statements, which is more than a few too many.

<div class="footnote">
<sup>1</sup> When Swift came out, it was a hardcore <a href="http://www.oranlooney.com/lbyl-vs-eafp/">LBYL</a> language. Now that it has <code>try</code> statements, the language feels confused. I don't know which is more "Swifty".

<sup>2</sup> In Python, the community has strong opinions about what's "Pythonic". The way Apple recommends developers write Swift will have a huge influence on what becomes the "Swifty" style.
