I just finished *Words of Radiance*, book 2 of the [Stormlight Archive][sa], [Brandon Sanderson's][sand] ongoing Epic Fantasy series. If you haven't heard of this series, or its author you *need* to check it out. The planned 10-part series takes place in a war-torn land of failing kings, squabbling princedoms, and magical knights long thought to be gone forever.

When the king is assassinated by a mysterious man with powers no one should have, the kingdom goes to war with his employer. All the while a young surgeon, turned soldier, turned slave discovers his powers, and a young girl tries to steal from the most respected and hated scholar in the world. 

If that little paragraph intro doesn't sell you, try a sample of the [Audible version of the book][aud]. The narrators are amazing as they bring Sanderson's enormous world to life.

I listened to the books via Audible, and I'd highly recommend them. The books are long (it is *Epic* fantasy after all) clocking in at around 1100 pages (45 hours of audio). It's a significant investment, but one that you'll be hooked to for every page/minute. 

If Audible sponsored, I'm sure that they'd give me a code for you to try the book, but I think you can try it via their 14-day trial anyway.

Give it a shot, the books were amazing. The bad thing is that, having finished them, I have to wait another [2 years][2y] to read the next one...
