Today marks the release of [Pine.blog's Fall Update][p]. It's a release I've been working on for months now and it feels great to finally get it out into the world. With this release, Pine.blog is now what I'd wanted it to be when I started [dreaming of what a the open web could do][1]. On Pine.blog, you can follow your interests, keep up with the latest news, and join the conversation by starting a blog. I can finally say that the core features I want are in place.

Obviously my goals for Pine.blog have expanded since I originally thought of the idea in 2014 (and began writing it in 2016), so there's still **a lot to do**.
