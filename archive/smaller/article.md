Text files are really small, and blog posts are just text files. Web pages are getting bigger and bigger over time. [Maciej Ceg≈Çowski][mc] calls it the "The Website Obesity Crisis" (and you should watch his talk). In response to this, I've removed some assets from this site that I wasn't using. Individual articles are now ~12KB plus images, as they should be.

<small>I guess I never realized that jQuery was ~90KB.</small>
