I've been chugging along with [Microblogger][1] the last couple of days, and progress has been good. Seeing as it's December 30th though, I doubt I'll make my [end of the year deadline][2]. Today, I added quite a bit of documentation and [even a wiki][3] to the project! I've also clarified the [issues][4] quite a bit, so if you're interested in helping out with the project, but aren't sure what you can help with, or if you want to read about how the project works go [check it out][5]!
