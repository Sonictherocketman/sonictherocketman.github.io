Interest in local news outlets has been declining over time. Bigger, flashier news outlets with more resources can attract more users and more traffic. But local news provides so much valuable information to the people living in the communities they serve and arguably this news generally effects reader's lives more than national news.

I've been thinking a lot lately about how [Pine.blog][pine] can help promote local news. Adding individual sections for each "locale" is obviously untenable since the Pine.blog directory is manually curated, but simply tagging a site as a "reputable local news outlet" might be enough. The issue then is deciding what  reputable", "local", and "news outlet" mean from the outside.
