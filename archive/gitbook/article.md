If you haven't heard, you should check out [GitBook][1]; it's really
cool. As a developer, writing in GitBook feels really natural, and their
styling options will make your content look great. If you want to go deeper, 
you can write your book in Markdown locally, and push it to GitBook just as 
you'd expect, or even host it on GitHub and generate it with GitBook. What's 
not to love?
