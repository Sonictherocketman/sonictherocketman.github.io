Other than my last post, it's been pretty quiet here lately. I've spent the majority of the last two months wrapping up the newest update to Pine.blog, which launched silently about a month ago. I meant to do a sort of announcement or retrospective post on the launch, but I just never got around to it.

A new [IndieDevLife][idl] is coming, but I haven't had the mental bandwidth to record an episode lately. I've been spending a lot of time reading and writing policy proposals for [Democracy &amp; Progress][dnp] and I've been pouring the remainder of my time into a new iOS app.

That's right, I've started yet another new app! It's in a private, early beta now, and I'm expecting the launch in May. No more details just yet, but I promise this one will be particularly special. I'm doing a lot that I've never done before, and playing with APIs I'd never heard of until now. It's fun stuff.
