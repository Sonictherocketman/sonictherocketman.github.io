title: Why I'm switching back to iTunes

Last week I decided to leave Spotify. I've been using the
service for almost 2 years now, and overall I've really liked it. Their
selection is great, their ability to stream audio over even the slowest
connection is constantly impressive, and while the app's UI isn't perfect, it
has gotten much better. As I said, I've really liked having Spotify, so why 
am I leaving?

Like [another service that I used to pay for but just cancelled][1], Spotify
hasn't sat well with me over the last few months. It's hard to explain why, but
I guess I feel apprehensive about Spotify being in control of how and where I
listen to music in ways I haven't been before. An example of my frustration 
happened last week when I was trying to AirPlay some music from the Spotify app 
on my iPhone to my media center running [OSMC][2]. When I went looking in the 
AirPlay settings for a destination, my media center showed up, but it wasn't playing.
Originally I thought it might be a bug between OSMC's AirPlay implementation and 
iOS 9, but when I tried streaming from the music app it worked fine. It also
worked fine from iTunes on my Mac, but not from Spotify.
This was extremely frustrating at the time, and it helped me reconcile the
feelings that I'd been having toward Spotify in the recent months. Spotify is a
great service, but like all proprietary services, it gets to decide
how/why/where you can use it's material. This wasn't the first time I'd felt
stuck because of Spotify's imposed limitations, it was just the last straw. I 
decided to resurrect my old music library, [give iTunes a new icon][3], purchase 
the music I wanted outright, and cancel Spotify.

Now I know that iTunes is proprietary software with it's own set of limitations
and hurdles, but the music I've purchased from it is mine. I have access to the
raw audio files, and I can convert, burn, and AirPlay them anywhere I want. As
long as it is technically possible to AirPlay to a device it should work, and 
that's becoming more and more important to me. 

iTunes is not a great piece of software; it's overcrowded with features, and
begging for a redesign and simplification, but with it's latest release it has
gotten better. Once I cleaned out my old music library and basically started
from scratch, I've really enjoyed using it, and with iCloud music library, I 
get the my-music-is-always-on-whatever-device-I'm-using benefit of a streaming 
service. Although I now have to go back and purchase my favorite albums
again, overall I'm happy with my decision. 

<div class="footnote">

1. Another reason I've wanted to switch away from Spotify that is less relevant to
this discussion is that since I don't usually listen to a new album every
month, the cost of paying for a streaming service monthly is a little hard to
justify.
