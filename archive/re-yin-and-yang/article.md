It sucks to know that one of my favorite shows, but really anything popular on the internet, has to deal with crap like this. [ATP][1], as I said, is one of my favorite shows. Are there times when I skip a section? Yeah. Are there episodes I've never finished because it just didn't pique my interest this time? Sure. Is it still a great show? Absolutely. I'm sorry that the hosts of ATP have to deal with crap like this, and I hope that it doesn't discourage them too much. 

To all the guys on ATP: You have a great show. Keep doing great work.
