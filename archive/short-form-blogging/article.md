Blogging is supposed to be fun. [Gina Trapani][1]'s heuristics for a blog post are pretty simple, and obvious. But sometimes we need to hear something from someone else for it to really sink in.

> <b>If it's a paragraph, it's a post.</b> Medium-sized content gets short shrift these days. Don't go long. One or two paragraphs count. Then press publish.

> <b>Negotiate a comfort zone on two axes:</b> personal and public, tech and everything else (feminism, musical theater, MMA, parenting, etc). 2001-era Scribbling.net was too personal, Lifehacker/Smarterware too tech. There's something in the middle.

> <b>Traffic is irrelevant.</b> Don't even measure it.
