## It's Been Fun

Pine.blog was developed in 2017 as a side project and continued to receive regular updates and even a native app (with a planned macOS app) in 2019. However, over time the situation with Pine.blog never improved to the point of achieving profitability or sustainability with its increasingly complex development. As well, over time my desire to build/maintain and the outlook for social media apps in general diminished and I didn't feel the fire burning in my heart to work on it any longer.

The app had at one point a decent userbase, and one that, if the fire still burned bright, perhaps I would have continued to develop for, however that was not the case.

I met a number of amazing people building this app and learned a ton about how the open web works both technically and socially.

So long Pine.blog, it was fun while it lasted.
