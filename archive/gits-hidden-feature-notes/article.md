When I'm programming I tend to create a lot of experimental branches to test my ideas before actually implementing them, and a lot of times I'll leave these branches in some half-state or with uncommitted changes. Then when I come back I've forgotten what I was doing and why. After running into exactly this problem earlier today, I started wondring if there was something built into Git that would give me a place to write notes to myself without committing.

Well, apparently there is: Git has built in notes!

According [to the docs][docs] you can use the command `git notes` which:

> Adds, removes, or reads notes attached to objects, without touching the objects themselves.

It's always exciting for me to discover a cool new tool, and even more so when I learn more about one I already use.
