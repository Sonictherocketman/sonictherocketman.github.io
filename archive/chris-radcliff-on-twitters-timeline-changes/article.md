<div class='link'>For some users, filtering like this means nothing less than the end of Twitter. That may seem overblown, but I think it's a fair assessment. To be specific: <span style='font-weight:bold;'>filtering the timeline changes Twitter from a communications service into a news or entertainment service, which is inherently less valuable to me as a Twitter user.</span></div>

I feel the same way.
