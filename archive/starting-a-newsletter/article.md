I'm a few years late to the trend here, but I've gone ahead and set up a [newsletter](https://sendfox.com/brianschrader/) for those of you that are interested in getting these posts delivered direct to your inbox.

I personally use an RSS reader, though I realize that I'm a dying breed these days, but I don't want to exclude anyone who wants to see my posts but just isn't into RSS.

This has been a long time coming, so I'm happy to finally have it done. You can subscribe to this post and all my upcoming ones at the link above.

Don't worry, nothing is going to change here. I'm just adding a new way to follow this blog. There's a lot more to come and I promise you, it'll be exciting stuff.

You should subscribe :)
