It's been a few busy weeks since I first [launched Pine][pine], a new kind of Feed Reader. And while it's not quite ready for prime-time yet, here's a sneak peek at the official Pine app for iOS.

**The app will be free and require a Pine subscription** to use. My favorite features though are the **Dark Mode** and **Dark App Icon** support.

The first version of the app is pretty bare bones with only only a few screens: your timeline, likes listing, and full article view. And while you'll of course be able to share and like posts, Version 1.0 will not have any sort of search or follow/unfollow support (though that's coming soon afterwards).

<div class="image-container">
<img
    class="pine-screenshot"
    src="/images/blog/pine/820-likes-dark.PNG"
/>
<img
    class="pine-screenshot"
    src="/images/blog/pine/820-post-light.PNG"
/>
<img
    class="pine-screenshot"
    src="/images/blog/pine/820-post-dark.PNG"
/>
</div>

Deciding what to cut and what to keep is always hard, but I've once you've set up Pine in the browser, this version of the app should have enough features for a nice day-to-day experience.

I've been using the app for a couple of days now and it's really shaping up into something special. Hopefully it will be ready for launch soon.
