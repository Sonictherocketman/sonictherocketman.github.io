I've been looping this album for the last 3 days. If you like space and the Apollo missions, then you need to listen to [Race for Space][1] the debut album from [Public Service Broadcasting][2] ([spotify link][3]). 

The entire album is a collection of radio transmissions from the Apollo
missions put to music. Yeah, cool right?
