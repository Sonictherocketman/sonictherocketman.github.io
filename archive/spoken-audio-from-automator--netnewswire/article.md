title: Spoken Audio from Automator & NetNewsWire

For those of you out there who still use RSS, and in particular NetNewsWire, I've put together a workflow in Automator that can take the currently selected article and generate an audio file of the spoken text.

I never will wrap my head around AppleScript's peculiar syntax, but regardless I've made the workflow file available for download below.

I typically use this with [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) which allows me to upload files to listen on the go.

Like most people, I want to read more articles than I actually do and this is little script will hopefully help with that.

It might take a while to complete, based on the length of the article, and it saves the final audio file to your desktop.

(warning you do need FFMpeg installed)
