<center><p>There once was a tree, just an ordinary tree, <br>An ordinary tree with a dream, <br>To be the tallest tree on the hillside, <br>It loved the coastal breeze, <br>And to stretch out its leaves, <br>And it loved all the birds that called it home. <br><br>One day the winds came howling, roaring, goring and growling,<br>They caught the tree off guard, <br>And waived it back and forth, <br>Its roots could hold no more, <br>And down it went,<br><br>And so the tree laid there, sad and frozen stiff, <br>Until a smart young student came about, <br>She saw the poor tree shivering, <br>She knew the tree was cold and all alone. <br><br>She gave the tree a present, <br>To keep it warm and cheery, <br>And now the tree is happy once again. <br><br>So if you see a tree, sad and all alone, <br>Why not knit it a cozy little sweater. <br>It would make the tree so happy, <br>And it will make you happy too, <br>And it will give passers-by a laugh. <br><br><a href="http://images.biteofanapple.com/blog/tree-with-sweater.jpg"><img class="body-image-center" src="http://images.biteofanapple.com/blog/tree-with-sweater.jpg" style="width:60%;"></a><br><br>Cheers to you: fallen-tree-sweater-knitter. </center>
