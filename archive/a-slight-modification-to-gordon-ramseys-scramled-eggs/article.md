title: A Slight Modification to Gordon Ramsey's Scramled Eggs

If you haven't seen [Gordon Ramsey's scrambled egg video][eggs], you should. It's been out for years now, but good cooking tips are always useful. Being in Southern California though, I make one slight modification: I use Sour cream instead of Crème fraîche. Originally I started doing this because I almost always have Sour cream on hand (again because Southern California) and while there's certainly a difference in flavor, it's a great substitute.
