This kind of thing is happening more and more. First it was Facebook, and few people cared. Then it was Twitter and people got mad. Now, Youtube. CGP Grey brings up a very good point though: Platforms do this to make money. They have to do this to make money. It just sucks that how they make money is by compromising the people that made the service what it is (\*cough\* Twitter \*cough\*).
