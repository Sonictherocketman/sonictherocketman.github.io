> Create systems that are ambivalent about the open or closed web. If I create a tool that's good at posting content to Facebook and Twitter, it should also post to RSS feeds, which exist outside the context of any corporation. Now other generous and innovative people can build systems that work differently from Facebook and Twitter, using these feeds as the basis...

Fantastic advice. We developers should provide a feature like this in our apps/services. I know I'd use it in heartbeat. A proactive dev could use this feature to allow their users to leave Twitter/Facebook and still use their favorite apps.

This also gives me an idea.
